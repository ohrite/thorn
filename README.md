# Thorn

An experiment in implementing Scheme, inspired by
[Peter Norvig's Lispy](http://norvig.com/lispy.html) dialect.

To experiment with Thorn, run `bin/repl` for an interactive prompt.

## Usage

Thorn is a small Scheme with, at the moment, no bindings to anything.

However, you can do fun things like:

```
(define thorn (quote (sorta useless right now)))
```

And then watch all the AST garbage come out!
